  The 'grep' function searches for occurrences of a regular expression
'pattern' in a set of files, and prints lines that match. This is like a
highly-simplified version of grep(1).
  The options are: 
  
 q  If specified, the output from 'grep' is not displayed. 
 h  If specified, output lines will not include the filename (default,
   when only one input file is given). 
 n  If specified, output lines include the filename (default, when more
   than one input file is given). 
 v  If specified, search for lines without a match instead of lines with
   a match, 
  
  The 'pattern' is a regular expression.
  If successful ('grep' found a match), the function returns 'true'.
Otherwise, it returns 'false'.

     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The 'scan' function provides input processing in command-line form.
The function takes file/filename arguments. If called with no arguments,
the input is taken from 'stdin'. If arguments are provided, each
specifies an 'InChannel', or the name of a file for input. Output is
always to 'stdout'.
  The 'scan' function operates by reading the input one line at a time,
and processing it according to the following algorithm.
  For each line, the record is first split into fields, and the fields
are bound to the variables '$1, $2, ...'. The variable '$0' is defined
to be the entire line, and '$*' is an array of all the field values. The
'$(NF)' variable is defined to be the number of fields.
  Next, a case expression is selected. If 'string_i' matches the token
'$1', then 'body_i' is evaluated. If the body ends in an 'export', the
state is passed to the next clause. Otherwise the value is discarded.
  For example, here is an 'scan' function that acts as a simple command
processor.
<<    calc() =
         i = 0
         scan(script.in)
         case print
            println($i)
         case inc
            i = $(add $i, 1)
            export
         case dec
            i = $(sub $i, 1)
            export
         case addconst
            i = $(add $i, $2)
            export
         default
            eprintln($"Unknown command: $1")
>>
  
  The 'scan' function also supports several options.
<<    scan(options, files)
      ...
>>
  
  
  
 A  Parse each line as an argument list, where arguments may be quoted.
   For example, the following line has three words, "'ls'", "'-l'",
   "'Program Files'".
   <<       ls -l "Program Files"
        >>
 
 O  Parse each line using white space as the separator, using the usual
   OMake algorithm for string parsing. This is the default. 
 x  Once each line is split, reduce each word using the hex
   representation. This is the usual hex representation used in URL
   specifiers, so the string "Program Files" may be alternately
   represented in the form ProgramProgram+Files. 
  
  Note, if you want to redirect the output to a file, the easiest way is
to redefine the 'stdout' variable. The 'stdout' variable is scoped the
same way as other variables, so this definition does not affect the
meaning of 'stdout' outside the 'calc' function.
<<    calc() =
          stdout = $(fopen script.out, w)
          scan(script.in)
             ...
          close($(stdout))

10.11.5   awk
=============

<<   awk(input-files)

     ...
     default:

<<   awk(options, input-files)
     case pattern1:
        body1
     case pattern2:
        body2
     ...
     default:
        bodyd
>>
  
  The 'awk' function provides input processing similar to awk(1), but
more limited. The 'input-files' argument is a sequence of values, each
specifies an 'InChannel', or the name of a file for input. If called
with no options and no file arguments, the input is taken from 'stdin'.
Output is always to 'stdout'.
  The variables 'RS' and 'FS' define record and field separators as
regular expressions. The default value of 'RS' is the regular expression
'\r|\n|\r\n'. The default value of 'FS' is the regular expression '[
\t]'+.
  The 'awk' function operates by reading the input one record at a time,
and processing it according to the following algorithm.
  For each line, the record is first split into fields using the field
separator 'FS', and the fields are bound to the variables '$1, $2, ...'.
The variable '$0' is defined to be the entire line, and '$*' is an array
of all the field values. The '$(NF)' variable is defined to be the
number of fields.
  Next, the cases are evaluated in order. For each case, if the regular
expression 'pattern_i' matches the record '$0', then 'body_i' is
evaluated. If the body ends in an 'export', the state is passed to the
next clause. Otherwise the value is discarded. If the regular expression
contains '\(r\)' expression, those expression override the fields '$1,
$2, ...'.
  For example, here is an 'awk' function to print the text between two
delimiters '\begin{<name>}' and '\end{<name>}', where the '<name>' must
belong to a set passed as an argument to the 'filter' function.
<<    filter(names) =
         print = false
  
         awk(Awk.in)
         case $"^\\end\{\([:alpha:]+\)\}"
            if $(mem $1, $(names))
               print = false
               export
            export
         default
            if $(print)
               println($0)
         case $"^\\begin\{\([:alpha:]+\)\}"
            print = $(mem $1, $(names))
            export
>>
  
  Note, if you want to redirect the output to a file, the easiest way is
to redefine the 'stdout' variable. The 'stdout' variable is scoped the
same way as other variables, so this definition does not affect the
meaning of 'stdout' outside the 'filter' function.
<<    filter(names) =
          stdout = $(fopen file.out, w)
          awk(Awk.in)
             ...
          close($(stdout))
>>
  
  Options. 
  
 b  "Break" when evaluating cases. Only the first case that matches will
   be selected.

function immediately.

     case pattern2 [options]
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The 'fsubst' function provides a sed(1)-like substitution function.
Similar to 'awk', if 'fsubst' is called with no arguments, the input is
taken from 'stdin'. If arguments are provided, each specifies an
'InChannel', or the name of a file for input.
  The 'RS' variable defines a regular expression that determines a
record separator, The default value of 'RS' is the regular expression
'\r|\n|\r\n'.
  The 'fsubst' function reads the file one record at a time.
  For each record, the cases are evaluated in order. Each case defines a
substitution from a substring matching the 'pattern' to replacement text
defined by the body.
  Currently, there is only one option: 'g'. If specified, each clause
specifies a global replacement, and all instances of the pattern define
a substitution. Otherwise, the substitution is applied only once.
  Output can be redirected by redefining the 'stdout' variable.
  For example, the following program replaces all occurrences of an
expression 'word.' with its capitalized form.
<<    section
         stdout = $(fopen Subst.out, w)
         fsubst(Subst.in)
         case $"\<\([[:alnum:]]+\)\." g
            value $(capitalize $1).

10.11.7   lex
=============

<<   lex(files)

        body1
     case pattern2
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The 'lex' function provides a simple lexical-style scanner function.
The input is a sequence of files or channels. The cases specify regular
expressions. Each time the input is read, the regular expression that
matches the longest prefix of the input is selected, and the body is
evaluated.
  If two clauses both match the same input, the last one is selected for
execution. The 'default' case matches the regular expression '.'; you
probably want to place it first in the pattern list.
  If the body end with an 'export' directive, the state is passed to the
next clause.
  For example, the following program collects all occurrences of
alphanumeric words in an input file.
<<    collect-words($(files)) =
         words[] =
         lex($(files))
         default
            # empty
         case $"[[:alnum:]]+" g
            words[] += $0
            export
>>
  
  The 'default' case, if one exists, matches single characters. Since
  It is an error if the input does not match any of the regular
expressions.
  The 'break' function can be used to abort the loop.

     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  The 'lex-search' function is like the 'lex' function, but input that
does not match any of the regular expressions is skipped. If the clauses
include a 'default' case, then the 'default' matches any skipped text.
  For example, the following program collects all occurrences of
alphanumeric words in an input file, skipping any other text.
<<    collect-words($(files)) =
         words[] =
         lex-search($(files))
         default
            eprintln(Skipped $0)
         case $"[[:alnum:]]+" g
            words[] += $0
            export
>>

10.11.9   Lexer
===============

  The 'Lexer' object defines a facility for lexical analysis, similar to
the lex(1) and flex(1) programs.
  In omake, lexical analyzers can be constructed dynamically by
extending the 'Lexer' class. A lexer definition consists of a set of
directives specified with method calls, and set of clauses specified as
rules.
  For example, consider the following lexer definition, which is
intended for lexical analysis of simple arithmetic expressions for a
desktop calculator.
<<   lexer1. =
        extends $(Lexer)
  
        other: .
           eprintln(Illegal character: $* )
           lex()
  
        white: $"[[:space:]]+"
           lex()
  
        op: $"[-+*/()]"
           switch $*
           case +
              Token.unit($(loc), plus)
           case -
              Token.unit($(loc), minus)
           case *
              Token.unit($(loc), mul)
           case /
              Token.unit($(loc), div)
           case $"("
              Token.unit($(loc), lparen)
           case $")"
              Token.unit($(loc), rparen)
  
        number: $"[[:digit:]]+"
           Token.pair($(loc), exp, $(int $* ))
  
        eof: $"\'"
           Token.unit($(loc), eof)
>>
  
  This program defines an object 'lexer1' the extends the 'Lexer'
object, which defines lexing environment.
  The remainder of the definition consists of a set of clauses, each
with a method name before the colon; a regular expression after the
colon; and in this case, a body. The body is optional, if it is not
specified, the method with the given name should already exist in the
lexer definition.
  NB The clause that matches the longest prefix of the input is
selected. If two clauses match the same input prefix, then the last one
is selected. This is unlike most standard lexers, but makes more sense
for extensible grammars.
  The first clause matches any input that is not matched by the other
clauses. In this case, an error message is printed for any unknown
character, and the input is skipped. Note that this clause is selected
only if no other clause matches.
  The second clause is responsible for ignoring white space. If
whitespace is found, it is ignored, and the lexer is called recursively.
  The third clause is responsible for the arithmetic operators. It makes
use of the 'Token' object, which defines three fields: a 'loc' field
that represents the source location; a 'name'; and a 'value'.
  The lexer defines the 'loc' variable to be the location of the current
lexeme in each of the method bodies, so we can use that value to create
the tokens.
  The 'Token.unit($(loc), name)' method constructs a new 'Token' object
with the given name, and a default value.
  The 'number' clause matches nonnegative integer constants. The
'Token.pair($(loc), name, value)' constructs a token with the given name
and value.
  Lexer object operate on 'InChannel' objects. The method
'lexer1.lex-channel(channel)' reads the next token from the channel
argument.

10.11.10   Lexer matching
=========================
  
  During lexical analysis, clauses are selected by longest match. That
is, the clause that matches the longest sequence of input characters is
chosen for evaluation. If no clause matches, the lexer raises a
'RuntimeException'. If more than one clause matches the same amount of
input, the first one is chosen for evaluation.

10.11.11   Extending lexer definitions
======================================
  
  Suppose we wish to augment the lexer example so that it ignores
comments. We will define comments as any text that begins with the
string '(*', ends with '*)', and comments may be nested.
  One convenient way to do this is to define a separate lexer just to
skip comments.
<<   lex-comment. =
        extends $(Lexer)
  
        level = 0
  
        other: .
           lex()
  
        term: $"[*][)]"
           if $(not $(eq $(level), 0))
              level = $(sub $(level), 1)
              lex()
  
        next: $"[(][*]"
           level = $(add $(level), 1)
           lex()
  
        eof: $"\'"
           eprintln(Unterminated comment)
>>
  
  This lexer contains a field 'level' that keeps track of the nesting
level. On encountering a '(*' string, it increments the level, and for
'*)', it decrements the level if nonzero, and continues.
  Next, we need to modify our previous lexer to skip comments. We can do
this by extending the lexer object 'lexer1' that we just created.
<<   lexer1. +=
        comment: $"[(][*]"
           lex-comment.lex-channel($(channel))
           lex()
>>
  
  The body for the comment clause calls the 'lex-comment' lexer when a
comment is encountered, and continues lexing when that lexer returns.

10.11.12   Threading the lexer object
=====================================
  
  Clause bodies may also end with an 'export' directive. In this case
the lexer object itself is used as the returned token. If used with the
'Parser' object below, the lexer should define the 'loc', 'name' and
'value' fields in each 'export' clause. Each time the 'Parser' calls the
lexer, it calls it with the lexer returned from the previous lex
invocation.

10.11.13   Parser
=================

  The 'Parser' object provides a facility for syntactic analysis based
on context-free grammars.
  'Parser' objects are specified as a sequence of directives, specified
with method calls; and productions, specified as rules.
  For example, let's finish building the desktop calculator started in
the 'Lexer' example.
<<   parser1. =
        extends $(Parser)
  
        #
        # Use the main lexer
        #
        lexer = $(lexer1)
  
        #
        # Precedences, in ascending order
        #
        left(plus minus)
        left(mul div)
        right(uminus)
  
        #
        # A program
        #
        start(prog)
  
        prog: exp eof
           return $1
  
        #
        # Simple arithmetic expressions
        #
        exp: minus exp :prec: uminus
           neg($2)
  
        exp: exp plus exp
           add($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp minus exp
           sub($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp mul exp
           mul($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp div exp
           div($1, $3)
  
        exp: lparen exp rparen
           return $2
>>
  
  Parsers are defined as extensions of the 'Parser' class. A 'Parser'
object must have a 'lexer' field. The 'lexer' is not required to be a
'Lexer' object, but it must provide a 'lexer.lex()' method that returns
a token object with 'name' and 'value' fields. For this example, we use
the 'lexer1' object that we defined previously.
  The next step is to define precedences for the terminal symbols. The
precedences are defined with the 'left', 'right', and 'nonassoc' methods
in order of increasing precedence.
  The grammar must have at least one start symbol, declared with the
'start' method.
  Next, the productions in the grammar are listed as rules. The name of
the production is listed before the colon, and a sequence of variables
is listed to the right of the colon. The body is a semantic action to be
evaluated when the production is recognized as part of the input.
  In this example, these are the productions for the arithmetic
expressions recognized by the desktop calculator. The semantic action
performs the calculation. The variables '$1, $2, ...' correspond to the
values associated with each of the variables on the right-hand-side of
the production.

=============================
  
  The parser is called with the '$(parser1.parse-channel start,
channel)' or '$(parser1.parse-file start, file)' functions. The 'start'
argument is the start symbol, and the 'channel' or 'file' is the input
to the parser.

10.11.15   Parsing control
==========================
  
  The parser generator generates a pushdown automation based on LALR(1)
tables. As usual, if the grammar is ambiguous, this may generate
shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts. These conflicts are printed to
standard output when the automaton is generated.
  By default, the automaton is not constructed until the parser is first
used.
  The 'build(debug)' method forces the construction of the automaton.
While not required, it is wise to finish each complete parser with a
call to the 'build(debug)' method. If the 'debug' variable is set, this
also prints with parser table together with any conflicts.
  The 'loc' variable is defined within action bodies, and represents the
input range for all tokens on the right-hand-side of the production.

10.11.16   Extending parsers
============================
  
  Parsers may also be extended by inheritance. For example, let's extend
the grammar so that it also recognizes the '<<' and '>>' shift
operations.
  First, we extend the lexer so that it recognizes these tokens. This
time, we choose to leave 'lexer1' intact, instead of using the +=
operator.
<<   lexer2. =
        extends $(lexer1)
  
        lsl: $"<<"
           Token.unit($(loc), lsl)
  
        asr: $">>"
           Token.unit($(loc), asr)
>>
  
  Next, we extend the parser to handle these new operators. We intend
that the bitwise operators have lower precedence than the other
arithmetic operators. The two-argument form of the 'left' method
accomplishes this.
<<   parser2. =
        extends $(parser1)
  
        left(plus, lsl lsr asr)
  
        lexer = $(lexer2)
  
        exp: exp lsl exp
           lsl($1, $3)
  
        exp: exp asr exp
           asr($1, $3)
>>
  
  In this case, we use the new lexer 'lexer2', and we add productions
for the new shift operations.

10.11.17   Passwd
=================

  The 'Passwd' object represents an entry in the system's user database.
It contains the following fields.
  
  
  'pw_name': the login name. 
  'pw_passwd': the encrypted password. 
  'pw_uid': user id of the user. 
  'pw_gid': group id of the user. 
  'pw_gecos': the user name or comment field. 
  'pw_dir': the user's home directory. 
  'pw_shell': the user's default shell. 
  
  Not all the fields will have meaning on all operating systems.

10.11.19   getpwents
====================

<<    $(getpwents) : Array
>>
  
  The 'getpwents' function returns an array of 'Passwd' objects, one for
every user fund in the system user database. Note that depending on the
operating system and on the setup of the user database, the returned
array may be incomplete or even empty.

10.11.20   Group
================

  The 'Group' object represents an entry in the system's user group
database. It contains the following fields.
  
  
  'gr_name': the group name. 
  'gr_group': the encrypted password. 
  'gr_gid': group id of the group. 
  'gr_mem': the group member's user names. 
  
  Not all the fields will have meaning on all operating systems.

         name : String
      $(getgrgid gid...) : Group
         gid : Int
      raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The 'getgrnam' function looks up a group entry by the group's name and
the 'getgrgid' function looks up an entry by groups's numerical id
(gid). If no entry is found, an exception will be raised.

10.11.22   tgetstr
==================

<<   $(tgetstr id) : String
        id : String
>>
  
  The 'tgetstr' function looks up the terminal capability with the
indicated 'id'. This assumes the terminfo to lookup is given in the
'TERM' environment variable. This function returns an empty value if the
given terminal capability is not defined.
  Note: if you intend to use the value returned by 'tgetstr' inside the
shell 'prompt', you need to wrap it using the 'prompt-invisible'
function.

===============================================
\@n
ame{function:xterm-escape-end}
<<   $(xterm-escape-begin) : String
     $(xterm-escape-end) : String
>>
  
  The 'xterm-escape-begin' and 'xterm-escape-end' functions return the
escape sequences that can be used to set the XTerm window title. Will
return empty values if this capability is not available.
  Note: if you intend to use these strings inside the shell 'prompt',
you need to use '$(prompt_invisible_begin)$(xterm-escape-begin)' and
'$(xterm-escape-end)$(prompt_invisible_end)'.

  When the 'TERM' environment variable indicates that the XTerm title
setting capability is available, '$(xterm-escape s)' is equivalent to
'$(xterm-escape-begin)s$(xterm-escape-end)'. Otherwise, it returns an
empty value.
  Note: if you intend to use the value returned by 'xterm-escape' inside
the shell 'prompt', you need to wrap it using the 'prompt-invisible'
function.
