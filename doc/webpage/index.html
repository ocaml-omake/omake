		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>OMake is a build system designed for scalability and portability.  It uses a syntax similar
           to <tt>make</tt> utilities you may have used, but it features many additional enhancements,
           including the following.</p>
		<ul>
          <li>Support for projects spanning several directories or directory hierarchies.
          <li>Fast, reliable, automated, scriptable dependency analysis using MD5 digests, with full
              support for incremental builds.
          <li>Dependency analysis takes the command lines into account &mdash;
          whenever the command line used to build a target changes, the target
          is considered out-of-date.
          <li>Fully scriptable, includes a library that providing support for standard tasks in
               C, C++, OCaml, and LaTeX projects, or a mixture thereof.
               <p> Often, a configuration file is as simple as a single line
                   <pre>.DEFAULT: $(CProgram prog, foo bar baz)</pre>
               which states that the program "<tt>prog</tt>" is built from the files <tt>foo.c</tt>,
               <tt>bar.c</tt>, and <tt>baz.c</tt>. This one line will also invoke the default
               standard library scripts for discovering implicit dependencies in C files (such as
               dependencies on included header files).
          </li>
          <li>Full native support for rules that build several files at once.
          <li>Portability: <tt>omake</tt> provides a uniform interface on Linux/Unix (including
          64-bit architectures), Win32, Cygwin, Mac OS X, and other platforms that are supported by
          <a href="http://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>.

          <li>Built-in functions that provide the most common features of programs
          like <tt>grep</tt>, <tt>sed</tt>, and <tt>awk</tt>.  These are especially useful on Win32.

          <li>Active filesystem monitoring, where the build automatically restarts whenever you
          modify a source file.  This can be very useful during the edit/compile cycle.

          <li>A built-in command-interpreter <tt>osh</tt> that can be used interactively.

        </ul>
        <p>OMake preserves the style of syntax and rule definitions used in <tt>Makefile</tt>s,
        making it easy to port your project to OMake.  There is no need to code in Perl (cons), or
        Python (scons).  However, there are a few things to keep in mind:
        <ol>
          <li>Indentation is significant, but tabs are not required.
          <li>The OMake language is functional: functions are first-class and there are no
          side-effects apart from I/O.
          <li>Scoping is dynamic.
        </ol>
